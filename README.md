# Simple Ragdoll System

A lightweight and customizable 2D ragdoll character system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic physics-based animation in the browser, making it ideal for educational purposes, prototyping, or creative experimentation.

> ⚠️ Note: The character does not yet support a self-standing mechanism.

## Features
- Fully browser-based 2D ragdoll simulation
- Easy to integrate and extend
- I added some comments to make it explain each code part roles

## Future Enhancements
- Self-standing functionality
- More realistic joint constraints
- Integration with user input or game logic

## Demo & Usage
Explore the ragdoll system in action , just download it and discover how it is simple ^_^ .
